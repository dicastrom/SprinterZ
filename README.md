# SprinterZ

Ever wanted to play a retro, console based game? Look no further!

With Sprinterz (patent pending ;) ) you will be able to watch real time as your favorite runners race each other.
You can play against a friend, against the computer or simply watch the computer race itself!
Each player starts with a balance of 10,000 credits for betting on the race, if they player guesses the right winner, they get to multiply thier bet by 5!!!
If they are wrong, they lose whatever they bet. Once a player (or the computer) gets to 0 credits, they lose...
The last player left alive wins!!!
